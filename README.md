# ENSF337

## Description
This is a culmination of all my assignments in ENSF 337 at the University of Calgary.

### What It Does
See ReadMe's within each individual assignment folder.

### Technologies Used
C/C++ was used only.

## Installation
A C/C++ interpreter and complier, such as Cygwin, is needed to run these assignments, and an IDE is recommended.

## Usage
Please do not sumbit any of these files as your own for any course work. While I'm happy to be contacted with questions on assignments, do not commit academic misconduct.
